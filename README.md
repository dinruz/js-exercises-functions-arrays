  • **Saying Bye to Grandma:**
    You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout 'BYE' 3 times **in a row** (If you say 'BYE' and then anything else, it won't count).

  💡  **Hint**:   Don't forget 'BYE' is not the same as 'BYE  ' or '  BYE '. Use `trim()`.

  ✨ **Feature:** More phrases stored in arrays that Grandma speaks randomly (depending on the input conditions).

### Detailed Array Exercises Descriptions

<details id="exercise-arr-1-camelize">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 1: Camelize()</strong></summary>

  Write the function `camelize(str)` that changes dash-separated words like “my-short-string” into camel-cased “myShortString”. That is: removes all dashes, each word after dash becomes uppercased. 
  
  Examples:

```javascript
camelize("background-color") == 'backgroundColor';
camelize("list-style-image") == 'listStyleImage';
camelize("-webkit-transition") == 'WebkitTransition';
```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-2-filter-range">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 2: Filter range</strong></summary>

  Write a function `filterRange(arr, a, b)` that gets an array `arr`, looks for elements with values higher or equal to a and lower or equal to b and return a result as an array.
  For instance:

```javascript
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
let filtered = filterRange(arr, 1, 4);
alert( filtered ); // 3,1 (matching values)
// alert( arr ); // 5,3,8,1 (not modified)
```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-3-filter-range-in-place">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 3: Filter range in place</strong></summary>
  
  Write a function `filterRangeInPlace(arr, a, b)` that gets an array `arr` and removes from it all values except those that are between a and b. The test is: 'a ≤ arr[i] ≤ b'.

  The function should only modify the array. It should not return anything.

```javascript
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
filterRangeInPlace(arr, 1, 4); // removed the numbers except from 1 to 4
// alert( arr ); // [3, 1]
```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-4-sort-in-decreasing-order">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 4: Sort in decreasing order</strong></summary>
  

  ```javascript
let arr = [5, 2, 1, -10, 8];
// ... 
  alert( arr ); // 8, 5, 2, 1, -10
```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-5-copy-and-sort-array">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 5: Copy and sort array</strong></summary>


  We have an array of strings 'arr'. We’d like to have a sorted copy of it, but keep 'arr' unmodified.

  Create a function `copySorted(arr)` that returns such a copy.

```javascript
let arr = ["HTML", "JavaScript", "CSS"];
let sorted = copySorted(arr);
alert( sorted ); // CSS, HTML, JavaScript
// alert( arr ); // HTML, JavaScript, CSS (no changes)
```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-6-shuffle-an-array">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 6: Shuffle an array</strong></summary>

  Write the function `shuffle(array)` that shuffles (randomly reorders) elements of the array.
  Multiple runs of shuffle may lead to different orders of elements. 
  For instance:

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [3, 2, 1]
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [2, 1, 3]
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [3, 1, 2]
  // ...
```
All element orders should have an equal probability.
For instance, [1,2,3] can be reordered as [1,2,3] or [1,3,2] or [3,1,2] etc, with equal probability of each case.

💡 **Tip:** To use a shuffle method, google **Fisher-Yates Shuffle.**

</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-7-filter-unique">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 7: Filter unique array members</strong></summary>

Let `arr` be an array. Create a function `unique(arr)` that should return an array with unique items of 'arr'.
For instance:

  ```javascript
  
  function unique(arr) {
    /* your code */
    }
    let strings = ["Hare", "Krishna", "Hare", "Krishna",
    "Krishna", "Krishna", "Hare", "Hare", ":-O"
    ];
    alert( unique(strings) ); // Hare, Krishna, :-O
  ```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-8-fizzbuzz-pro">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 8: FizzBuzz Pro</strong></summary>

Write a function `fizzBuzzPro(number)` that generates a modified FizzBuzz sequence up to a given number.

Function should: 

  - iterate from 1 up to number;
  - apply **standard FizzBuzz rules:**
    * print "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5;
    * print "Fizz" for multiples of 3;
    * print "Buzz" for multiples of 5;

  - apply **special rule**:
    * if a number contains the digit "7", it outputs "Bang!" instead of any FizzBuzz variant

    - return a single string of the results, separated by `, ` with a `.` at the very end.

  ```javascript
  
    fizzBuzzPro(20) // Expected: "1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, Bang!, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, Bang!, 18, 19, Buzz."
  ```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-9-clean-and-capitalize">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 9: cleanAndCapitalize()</strong></summary>

Write a function `cleanAndCapitalize(text)` that takes one string and transforms the text in the following way:

* remove all punctuation characters (.,;:!?_-)
* capitalize the first letter of each word
* standardize spaces (only one space between words)

The function should return the final string like this:

  ```javascript
    cleanAndCapitalize("tHis-is somE--stranGE. text! ")
    // Expected output: "This Is Some Strange Text"

    cleanAndCapitalize(" THIS.one...   TOo_  ")
    // Expected output: "This One Too"

Create an array named `tempC` containing several numbers. These numbers represent temperatures in Celsius.

Create a new array called `tempF`. Each element in the new array should be the corresponding Celsius temperature converted to Fahrenheit using the formula: `(temperature * 9/5) + 32`.

Output should look like this:

  ```javascript
  console.log(tempC); // expected: 0,10,20,30,-5,15
  console.log(tempF); // expected: 32,50,68,86,23,59
  ```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-11-filter-words">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 11: Filter Words</strong></summary>

Create an array `words` containing strings 'augmentation','desk','building','bed','affiliate','ant','sunshine','Ann'.

Create a new array `longWords` that contains only the words whose length is greater than 6 characters.
Create another new array `startWithA` that contains only the words that start with the letter 'a'(case-insensitive).

Log all three arrays to the console. Output should look like this:

  ```javascript
  console.log(words);        // augmentation,desk,building,bed,affiliate,ant,sunshine,Ann
  console.log(longWords);   //  augmentation,building,affiliate,sunshine
  console.log(startWithA); //   augmentation,affiliate,ant,Ann

Calculate the sum of all numbers in the array and store it in a variable `totalSum`.
Calculate the product of all numbers in the array and store it in a variable `totalProduct`.

Output should look like this:

  ```javascript
  console.log('Array of numbers: ',numbers);// Array of numbers: 1,2,3,4,5
  console.log('Total sum: ',totalSum, 'total product: ',totalProduct);// Total sum: 15, total product: 120
  ```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-13-test-results">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 13: Test Results</strong></summary>

Create an array `testResults` containing numbers ([85, 92, 78, 65, 95, 70, 88]) representing test results.

* Additional Requirement: Before adding, check if the item already exists in the inventory. If it does, log a message stating that you already possess the item and do not add it again (the inventory doesn't allow duplicate names).

* After Action: Always display the updated inventory.

Expected Output (for adding 'Healing Potion'):

```javascript
Adding Healing Potion...
Item added: Healing Potion
Your inventory: Sword, Shield, Potion, Bow, Arrows, Map, Healing Potion
```

Expected Output (for adding 'Map' - a duplicate):

```javascript
Adding Map...
You already have Map in your inventory.
Your inventory: Sword, Shield, Potion, Bow, Arrows, Map, Healing Potion
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong> 3. function `removeItem(itemName)`</strong></summary>


* Purpose: Removes a specific item from the inventory.

* Argument: itemName (string) - the name of the item to remove.

* Additional Requirement: If the item is not found in the inventory, log a message "Item [itemName] not found in inventory."

* After Action: Always display the updated inventory.

Expected Output (for removing 'Shield'):

```javascript
Attempting to remove Shield...
Shield removed from inventory.
Your inventory: Sword, Potion, Bow, Arrows, Map, Healing Potion
```

Expected Output (for removing 'NonExistentItem'):

```javascript
Attempting to remove NonExistentItem...
Item NonExistentItem not found in inventory.
Your inventory: Sword, Potion, Bow, Arrows, Map, Healing Potion
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>4. function `hasItem(itemName)`</strong></summary>

* Purpose: Checks if the player possesses a specific item.

* Argument: itemName (string) - the name of the item to check for.

* Output: A clear message to the console indicating whether the item is possessed or not.

Expected Output (for 'Sword'):

```javascript
You have Sword in your inventory.
```

Expected Output (for 'Magic Orb'):

```javascript
You do not have Magic Orb in your inventory.
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>5. function `sortInventory()`</strong></summary>

* Purpose: Sorts the items in the inventory in alphabetical (lexicographical) order.

* After Action: Always display the sorted inventory.

Expected Output:

```javascript
Sorting inventory...
Your inventory: Arrows, Bow, Healing Potion, Map, Potion, Sword
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>6. function `getItemLengths()`</strong></summary>

* Purpose: Returns a new array containing the length (number of characters) of each item name in the inventory. The original inventory should remain unchanged.

Expected Output (for example after initial items):

```javascript
Item name lengths: [5, 6, 6, 3, 6, 3]
```

💡 **Hint**: *This is a classic use case for the `map()` method.*

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>7. Function `getShortItems(maxLength)`</strong></summary>

*  Purpose: Returns a new array containing only the items from the inventory whose names have a length less than or equal to maxLength. The original inventory should remain unchanged.

* Argument: maxLength (number) - the maximum allowed length for item names.

Expected Output (for getShortItems(5)):

```javascript
Short items (<= 5 chars): "Bow","Map","Sword"

```
💡 **Hint:** The filter() method is perfect for this.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>8. Function `calculateTotalValue(itemValues)` |  challenging ✨</strong></summary>


* Purpose: Calculates the total "value" of all items currently in the inventory based on a provided map of item values.

* Argument: itemValues (object) - an object where keys are item names (strings) and values are their corresponding numeric values (e.g., { 'Sword': 100, 'Potion': 20, 'Arrows': 5, 'Map': 30 }). 

If an item in the inventory is **not found** in itemValues, its value should be considered 0.

Expected Output (example with provided itemValues):

```javascript
Calculating total inventory value...
Total inventory value: 155 gold
```
💡 **Hint:** *This is a prime candidate for the `reduce()` method, accumulating a sum based on item lookups.*
</details>


<details>
  <summary><strong> Testing your Implementation 🧪</strong></summary>


After implementing all the functions, add the following code to your .js file (below your function definitions) to test their functionality. 

This sequence of calls will demonstrate if your inventory manager works correctly.

```javascript

console.log("--- My Adventure Inventory Test ---");

console.log("My Adventure Inventory: Initial State");
displayInventory(myAdventureInventory);

console.log("Adding New Gear...");
addItem(myAdventureInventory, 'Elixir of Life');
addItem(myAdventureInventory, 'Magical map'); // This should fail gracefully
addItem(myAdventureInventory, 'Rope');

console.log("Removing Unwanted Items...");
removeItem(myAdventureInventory, 'Leather armor');
removeItem(myAdventureInventory, 'Rusty dagger'); // This should fail as it's not present
removeItem(myAdventureInventory, 'Health potion');

console.log("Is the Gear Present?");
hasItem(myAdventureInventory, 'Steel sword');
hasItem(myAdventureInventory, 'Elixir of life');

  <summary><strong>Exercise 18: Kubrick Filmography</strong></summary>
Create a system for managing and analyzing Stanley Kubrick's filmography using only arrays.

**Rules**
*  Data Format: The movies are stored in a nested array. Each inner array represents one movie: [title, year, genres]. Genres are also a nested array.

*  Case Handling: Movie titles should be Title Case. Genres are also Title Case. Years are numbers.

*  Return Values: Functions must return a new array or a single value (like a number or a string). Do not modify the original array.

💡 **Hint:** For a neat and clean output of your data in the console, you can use console.table().

**Setup**
```javaScript
let kubrickMovies = [
  ['2001: A Space Odyssey', 1968, ['Sci-Fi', 'Adventure']],
  ['The Shining', 1980, ['Horror', 'Psychological Thriller']],
  ['A Clockwork Orange', 1971, ['Sci-Fi', 'Dystopian']],
  ['Full Metal Jacket', 1987, ['War', 'Drama']],
  ['Dr. Strangelove', 1964, ['Satire', 'Comedy']],
  ['Eyes Wide Shut', 1999, ['Drama', 'Mystery']]
];
```

**The Challenge (functions to write)**

`getMoviesByGenre(genre, movies)`

Return a new array containing only the titles of the movies that belong to a specific genre.

`getMoviesAfterYear(year, movies)`

Return a new array containing all the movies released after the specified year. This array should be sorted in ascending order by release year.

`getUniqueGenres(movies)`

Return a new array containing all the unique genres from all movies. The genres should be sorted alphabetically.

`findMostProductiveDecade(movies)`

Find the decade in which the most movies were filmed. Return a string that describes that decade, e.g., '1960s'.

<details id="exercise-arr-19-literature-analysis">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 19: Literature Analysis</strong></summary>

You are a digital librarian building functions to analyze a collection of classic literature. The data is stored in an array, where each element contains: `[Title, Author, Year, Pages, [Genres], Country]`.

**Rules and Edge Cases**

Your functions must work with all authors, regardless of their country.

Pay attention to duplicates if the same author appears in multiple books.

Some books can have multiple genres, which must be taken into account.

**Write functions:**

**1. `getAllRussianAuthors()`**

- returns an array of all unique Russian author names (only those whose 'Country' is 'Russia') from the collection.

**2. `getAveragePageCountByGenre()`**

- takes a 'genre' as an argument and returns the average number of pages for all books belonging to that genre.

**3. `getBooksWrittenBefore()`**

- returns an array of book titles that were written before a specific 'year', sorted alphabetically by title.

**Initial data**

```javascript
const classicBooks = [
  ['War and Peace', 'Leo Tolstoy', 1869, 1225, ['Epic', 'Historical'], 'Russia'],
  ['Crime and Punishment', 'Fyodor Dostoevsky', 1866, 520, ['Philosophical', 'Crime'], 'Russia'],

Write some functions to analyze historical space mission data. 
The mission data is provided as a nested array, where each element represents a single mission.
The structure for each mission is: `[Mission Name, Year, Status, [Crew Members]]`.

**Rules**

Use array methods instead of traditional `for` loops.

**Write functions:**

**1. `getAllSuccessfulMissions()`**

Create a function that quickly identifies all missions that have been a 'Success'. The function should return an array containing only the names of these missions.

**2.`getAverageCrewSizeByDecade()`** | challenging ✨

Write a function that calculates the average number of crew members per mission for each decade. 

The function must return a new, nested array where each inner array contains the decade and the average crew size, e.g., [['1960s', 3], ['1970s', 3], ...].

**3. `findUniqueCrewMembers()`**

Get a list of all unique astronauts who have participated in a mission. Write a function that returns a new array with the names of every crew member. Make sure there are no duplicates and that you filter out any placeholder values like 'N/A'.

<details id="exercise-arr-21-manipulation-challenge">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 21: Array Manipulation Challenges</strong></summary>
 
This comprehensive suite of exercises progresses from basic usage to complex scenarios where you'll need to strategically choose and combine methods to solve problems efficiently.

<details>
 <summary><strong>[🔥]  Warm-up Exercise</strong></summary>

*The task is to double every number in the following array using two different methods.*

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
**Method 1: `for loop`**

Write a for loop that iterates through the numbers array and creates a new array called doubledFor with each number doubled.

**Method 2: `.map() method`**

Write a single line of code using the .map() method to create a new array called doubledMap with each number doubled.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>[🟢] Basic Array Operations </strong></summary>

*For this challenge, goal is to use the specified array methods to perform basic transformations and calculations.*

Here is the initial array:
```javascript
const mixedArray = [10, 'apple', 25, 42, 'banana', 15, 30, 'cherry'];
```

**Part 1: Filtering and Mapping**

* Filter: Use the `.filter()` method to create a new array called filteredNumbers that contains only the numbers from mixedArray.

* Map: Use the `.map()` method on filteredNumbers to create a new array called mappedStrings where each number is converted into a string (e.g., 10 becomes 'Number: 10').

**Part 2: Reduction and Calculation**

* Reduce: Use the `.reduce()` method on filteredNumbers to calculate the sum of all the numbers. Store the result in a variable called totalSum.

* Reduce (Alternative Use): Use the `.reduce()` method on filteredNumbers to find the largest number. Store the result in a variable called largestNumber.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>[🟡] Intermediate Array Operations </strong></summary>

*These tasks introduce more complex logic and method chaining.*

```javascript
const mixedArray = [10, 'apple', 25, 42, 'banana', 15, 30, 'cherry'];
```

**Part 3: forEach and Conditional Logic**

* forEach: Use the `.forEach()` method on mixedArray to iterate through each element. For each element, print a message to the console:

  * If the element is a number and is greater than 20, print:
  ```javascript 
  The number [number] is greater than 20.
  ```
  
  *If the element is a string, print:
  ```javascript
  The string is [string].
  ```
*  Otherwise, print:
 ```javascript
 The value [value] is not a large number or a string.
```

**Part 4: Combining Methods**

* Chain Methods: In a single line of code, chain the `.filter()` and `.map()` methods on mixedArray to get an array of strings like ['Number: 25', 'Number: 42', 'Number: 15', 'Number: 30']. Store the result in a variable called chainedResult.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>[🟠] Choose & Use Challenge </strong></summary>

*These challenges require selecting the most appropriate array method(s) to solve the given problems.*

**Challenge 1: Value Count**

* Problem: Determine the number of numeric values present in the mixedArray.

* Expected result: An integer representing the total number of numbers in the array (in this case, 5).

**Challenge 2: Descending Order**

* Problem: Create a new array from filteredNumbers with its elements arranged from the highest value to the lowest.

* Expected result: [42, 30, 25, 15, 10]

**Challenge 3: Unique Collection**

* Problem: Transform the array ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'd', 'b'] into a new array that contains each element only once.

* Expected result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

**Challenge 4: Mixed Transformation**

* Problem: Process the mixedArray to produce a new array where all numeric values are squared, and all string values are in uppercase.

* Expected result: [100, 'APPLE', 625, 1764, 'BANANA', 225, 900, 'CHERRY']

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>[🔴] Score Analytics </strong></summary>

*This challenge require combining multiple array methods and logical thinking to solve problems efficiently. Aim for concise solutions.*

Here is the array for this challenge:
```javascript
const scores = [15, 25, 15, 50, 45, 25, 15, 60, 5, 25, 10];
```

**Challenge 1: Filtering and Summation**

* Problem: From the scores array, extract all scores greater than 20 and calculate their sum.

* Expected result: 230

**Challenge 2: Counting Occurrences**

* Problem: From the scores array, find out how many times the score 25 was achieved.

* Expected result: 3

**Challenge 3: Transformation and Uniqueness**

* Problem: From the scores array, create a new array containing only unique values (no duplicates), sorted from highest to lowest.

* Expected result: [60, 50, 45, 25, 15, 10, 5]

<summary><strong>[🧪] Test Cases</strong></summary>



**I. Place Your Code**

 Write your JavaScript solutions for each challenge directly above these "Test Cases" in the same file or script block. Ensure that your results are stored in the variable names specified in the comments (e.g., doubledFor, filteredNumbers, totalSum, etc.).

**II. Run Your Code**

 Open this HTML file (or run the JavaScript) in a web browser.

**III. Check the Console**

 Open your browser's developer console ( press F12 or right-clicking and selecting 'Inspect' -> 'Console').

**Interpret Results:**

✅ PASS: Means your code produced the expected output for that specific test.

❌ FAIL: Means your code produced an output that did not match the expected result. 

The console will show you both what was expected and what your code returned, helping you debug.


```javascript
// Helper function for asserting equality
function assertEqual(actual, expected, testName) {
    const areArraysEqual = (arr1, arr2) => {
        if (!Array.isArray(arr1) || !Array.isArray(arr2)) return actual === expected;
        if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) return false;
        for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    };

    if (areArraysEqual(actual, expected)) {
        console.log(`✅ PASS: ${testName}`);
    } else {
        console.error(`❌ FAIL: ${testName} - Expected: ${JSON.stringify(expected)}, Got: ${JSON.stringify(actual)}`);
    }
}

// --- Warm-up Exercise Tests ---
// Assuming you store the results in `doubledFor` and `doubledMap`
// Example: const doubledFor = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
// Example: const doubledMap = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
assertEqual(doubledFor, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], "Warm-up: doubledFor using for loop");
assertEqual(doubledMap, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], "Warm-up: doubledMap using .map()");

// --- Easy Challenge Tests ---
// Assuming you store the results in `filteredNumbers`, `mappedStrings`, `totalSum`, `largestNumber`
// Example: const filteredNumbers = [10, 25, 42, 15, 30];
// Example: const mappedStrings = ['Number: 10', 'Number: 25', 'Number: 42', 'Number: 15', 'Number: 30'];
// Example: const totalSum = 122;
// Example: const largestNumber = 42;

<details id="exercise-arr-22-log-files">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 22: Log Files</strong></summary>
This exercise simulates processing data from a simple log file. Your goal is to extract useful information and summarize it.

```javascript

const logLines = [
  "INFO: User 'john' logged in.",
  "WARN: Disk space low.",
  "INFO: User 'sarah' logged out.",
  "INFO: User 'john' logged out.",
  "ERROR: Database connection failed.",
  "INFO: User 'mike' logged in.",
  "WARN: High CPU usage.",
  "INFO: User 'john' logged in."
];
```

* From the 'logLines' array, create a new array containing only the lines that start with "INFO".

Expected outcome:

```javascript
[
  "INFO: User 'john' logged in.",
  "INFO: User 'sarah' logged out.",
  "INFO: User 'john' logged out.",
  "INFO: User 'mike' logged in.",
  "INFO: User 'john' logged in."
]
```

* Create a variable that holds the total number of "logged in" actions in the 'logLines' array.

Expected outcome: 3

* From the 'logLines' array, create an array of strings that contain only the unique usernames (e.g., 'john', 'sarah', 'mike'). Then, sort them in alphabetical order.

Expected outcome:

```javascript
['john', 'mike', 'sarah']
```

* Create a data structure that maps each unique username to the number of times they logged in. The keys should be the usernames and the values should be the login counts.

Expected outcome:

```javascript

// The data structure can be an object or array

{
  john: 2,
  sarah: 0,
  mike: 1
}
```

<details id="exercise-arr-24-user-messages">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 23: Challenge - User Messages</strong></summary>
This challenge is designed to test  understanding of array methods (map, filter, reduce) and their combination with various string methods. The task is to process a set of raw user messages and extract meaningful information.

Starting Array:
```javaScript

const rawMessages = [
  "   @johnny_b: Hello, everyone! #intro",
  "  @sara_h: What a beautiful day! #nature",
  "   @johnny_b: I'm really enjoying this project. #coding",
  "    @mike_m: New ideas are coming. #brainstorm",
  "  @sara_h: Another #nature walk. #outdoors",
  " @mike_m: Let's meet up soon. #plans",
  " @johnny_b: Looking forward to the #weekend",
  " @johnny_b: #coding is fun! #intro",
];
```

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Cleaning Messages and Extracting Tags</strong></summary>
* Create a new array called 'cleanedMessages' that contains only the message text, with leading/trailing whitespace removed and the username (everything starting with '@' up to the first space) stripped out.

* From 'cleanedMessages', create a new array called 'allTags' that contains all the hashtags (without the # symbol) from every message. Be careful with messages that contain multiple hashtags.

```javascript
cleanedMessages: [
  "Hello, everyone! #intro",
  "What a beautiful day! #nature",
  "I'm really enjoying this project. #coding",
  "New ideas are coming. #brainstorm",
  "Another #nature walk. #outdoors",
  "Let's meet up soon. #plans",
  "Looking forward to the #weekend",
  "#coding is fun! #intro"
]

allTags: [
  "intro",
  "nature",
  "coding",
  "brainstorm",
  "nature",
  "outdoors",
  "plans",
  "weekend",
  "coding",
  "intro"
]
```

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>2. Analyzing Tag Frequency</strong></summary>
Based on the 'allTags' array, create an array of strings called 'tagFrequencies' where each element is in the format "tag: count". The tags should be unique, and the counts should represent how many times they appeared.

Expected Outcome:

```javascript

tagFrequencies: [
  "intro: 2",
  "nature: 2",
  "coding: 2",
  "brainstorm: 1",
  "outdoors: 1",
  "plans: 1",
  "weekend: 1"
]
```

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>3. Filtering and Ranking Tags</strong></summary>

Using 'tagFrequencies', create a new array called 'topTags' that contains only the tags which appeared more than once, sorted from most frequent to least frequent. The tags should be a simple string (e.g., "tag"), without the count.

Expected Outcome:

```javaScript

topTags: [
  "intro",
  "nature",
  "coding"
]
```
📌 **Note:** 

In this specific case, "intro," "nature," and "coding" all have the same frequency, so the order among them can vary. The crucial part is that they all appeared more than once.
