### Detailed Array Exercises Descriptions

<details id="exercise-arr-1-camelize">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 1: Camelize()</strong></summary>

  Write the function `camelize(str)` that changes dash-separated words like ‚Äúmy-short-string‚Äù into camel-cased ‚ÄúmyShortString‚Äù. That is: removes all dashes, each word after dash becomes uppercased. 
  
  Examples:

```javascript
camelize("background-color") == 'backgroundColor';
camelize("list-style-image") == 'listStyleImage';
camelize("-webkit-transition") == 'WebkitTransition';
```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-2-filter-range">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 2: Filter range</strong></summary>

  Write a function `filterRange(arr, a, b)` that gets an array `arr`, looks for elements with values higher or equal to a and lower or equal to b and return a result as an array.
  For instance:

```javascript
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
let filtered = filterRange(arr, 1, 4);
alert( filtered ); // 3,1 (matching values)
// alert( arr ); // 5,3,8,1 (not modified)
```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-3-filter-range-in-place">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 3: Filter range in place</strong></summary>
  
  Write a function `filterRangeInPlace(arr, a, b)` that gets an array `arr` and removes from it all values except those that are between a and b. The test is: 'a ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ b'.

  The function should only modify the array. It should not return anything.

```javascript
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
filterRangeInPlace(arr, 1, 4); // removed the numbers except from 1 to 4
// alert( arr ); // [3, 1]
```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-4-sort-in-decreasing-order">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 4: Sort in decreasing order</strong></summary>
  

  ```javascript
let arr = [5, 2, 1, -10, 8];
// ... 
  alert( arr ); // 8, 5, 2, 1, -10
```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-5-copy-and-sort-array">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 5: Copy and sort array</strong></summary>


  We have an array of strings 'arr'. We‚Äôd like to have a sorted copy of it, but keep 'arr' unmodified.

  Create a function `copySorted(arr)` that returns such a copy.

```javascript
let arr = ["HTML", "JavaScript", "CSS"];
let sorted = copySorted(arr);
alert( sorted ); // CSS, HTML, JavaScript
// alert( arr ); // HTML, JavaScript, CSS (no changes)
```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-6-shuffle-an-array">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 6: Shuffle an array</strong></summary>

  Write the function `shuffle(array)` that shuffles (randomly reorders) elements of the array.
  Multiple runs of shuffle may lead to different orders of elements. 
  For instance:

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [3, 2, 1]
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [2, 1, 3]
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [3, 1, 2]
  // ...
```
All element orders should have an equal probability.
For instance, [1,2,3] can be reordered as [1,2,3] or [1,3,2] or [3,1,2] etc, with equal probability of each case.

üí° **Tip:** To use a shuffle method, google **Fisher-Yates Shuffle.**

</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-7-filter-unique">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 7: Filter unique array members</strong></summary>

Let `arr` be an array. Create a function `unique(arr)` that should return an array with unique items of 'arr'.
For instance:

  ```javascript
  
  function unique(arr) {
    /* your code */
    }
    let strings = ["Hare", "Krishna", "Hare", "Krishna",
    "Krishna", "Krishna", "Hare", "Hare", ":-O"
    ];
    alert( unique(strings) ); // Hare, Krishna, :-O
  ```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-8-fizzbuzz-pro">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 8: FizzBuzz Pro</strong></summary>

Write a function `fizzBuzzPro(number)` that generates a modified FizzBuzz sequence up to a given number.

Function should: 

  - iterate from 1 up to number;
  - apply **standard FizzBuzz rules:**
    * print "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5;
    * print "Fizz" for multiples of 3;
    * print "Buzz" for multiples of 5;

  - apply **special rule**:
    * if a number contains the digit "7", it outputs "Bang!" instead of any FizzBuzz variant

    - return a single string of the results, separated by `, ` with a `.` at the very end.

  ```javascript
  
    fizzBuzzPro(20) // Expected: "1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, Bang!, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, Bang!, 18, 19, Buzz."
  ```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-9-clean-and-capitalize">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 9: cleanAndCapitalize()</strong></summary>

Write a function `cleanAndCapitalize(text)` that takes one string and transforms the text in the following way:

* remove all punctuation characters (.,;:!?_-)
* capitalize the first letter of each word
* standardize spaces (only one space between words)

The function should return the final string like this:

  ```javascript
    cleanAndCapitalize("tHis-is somE--stranGE. text! ")
    // Expected output: "This Is Some Strange Text"

    cleanAndCapitalize(" THIS.one...   TOo_  ")

Calculate the sum of all numbers in the array and store it in a variable `totalSum`.
Calculate the product of all numbers in the array and store it in a variable `totalProduct`.

Output should look like this:

  ```javascript
  console.log('Array of numbers: ',numbers);// Array of numbers: 1,2,3,4,5
  console.log('Total sum: ',totalSum, 'total product: ',totalProduct);// Total sum: 15, total product: 120
  ```
</details>

---

<details id="exercise-arr-13-test-results">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 13: Test Results</strong></summary>

Create an array `testResults` containing numbers ([85, 92, 78, 65, 95, 70, 88]) representing test results.

Adding Healing Potion...
Your inventory: Sword, Shield, Potion, Bow, Arrows, Map, Healing Potion
```

Expected Output (for adding 'Map' - a duplicate):

```javascript
Adding Map...
You already have Map in your inventory.
Your inventory: Sword, Shield, Potion, Bow, Arrows, Map, Healing Potion
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong> 3. function `removeItem(itemName)`</strong></summary>


* Purpose: Removes a specific item from the inventory.

* Argument: itemName (string) - the name of the item to remove.

* Additional Requirement: If the item is not found in the inventory, log a message "Item [itemName] not found in inventory."

* After Action: Always display the updated inventory.

Expected Output (for removing 'Shield'):

```javascript
Attempting to remove Shield...
Shield removed from inventory.
Your inventory: Sword, Potion, Bow, Arrows, Map, Healing Potion
```

Expected Output (for removing 'NonExistentItem'):

```javascript
Attempting to remove NonExistentItem...
Item NonExistentItem not found in inventory.
Your inventory: Sword, Potion, Bow, Arrows, Map, Healing Potion
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>4. function `hasItem(itemName)`</strong></summary>

* Purpose: Checks if the player possesses a specific item.

* Argument: itemName (string) - the name of the item to check for.

* Output: A clear message to the console indicating whether the item is possessed or not.

Expected Output (for 'Sword'):

```javascript
You have Sword in your inventory.
```

Expected Output (for 'Magic Orb'):

```javascript
You do not have Magic Orb in your inventory.
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>5. function `sortInventory()`</strong></summary>

* Purpose: Sorts the items in the inventory in alphabetical (lexicographical) order.

* After Action: Always display the sorted inventory.

Expected Output:

```javascript
Sorting inventory...
Your inventory: Arrows, Bow, Healing Potion, Map, Potion, Sword
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>6. function `getItemLengths()`</strong></summary>

* Purpose: Returns a new array containing the length (number of characters) of each item name in the inventory. The original inventory should remain unchanged.

Expected Output (for example after initial items):

```javascript
Item name lengths: [5, 6, 6, 3, 6, 3]
```

üí° **Hint**: *This is a classic use case for the `map()` method.*

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>7. Function `getShortItems(maxLength)`</strong></summary>

*  Purpose: Returns a new array containing only the items from the inventory whose names have a length less than or equal to maxLength. The original inventory should remain unchanged.

* Argument: maxLength (number) - the maximum allowed length for item names.

Expected Output (for getShortItems(5) with current inventory):

```javascript
Short items (<= 5 chars): Sword, Bow, Map
Hint: The filter() method is perfect for this.
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>8. Function `calculateTotalValue(itemValues)` | ‚ú® challenging üåü</strong></summary>


* Purpose: Calculates the total "value" of all items currently in the inventory based on a provided map of item values.

* Argument: itemValues (object) - an object where keys are item names (strings) and values are their corresponding numeric values (e.g., { 'Sword': 100, 'Potion': 20, 'Arrows': 5, 'Map': 30 }). 

If an item in the inventory is not found in itemValues, its value should be considered 0.

Expected Output (example with provided itemValues):

```javascript
Calculating total inventory value...
Total inventory value: 155 gold
```
üí° **Hint:** *This is a prime candidate for the `reduce()` method, accumulating a sum based on item lookups.*

  <summary><strong>¬∞ Testing your Implementation ¬∞</strong></summary>


After implementing all the functions, add the following code to your .js file (below your function definitions) to test their functionality. 

This sequence of calls will demonstrate if your inventory manager works correctly.

```javascript
console.log("--- Initial Inventory ---");
displayInventory();

console.log("\n--- Scenario 1: Adding Items ---");
addItem('Healing Potion'); // Add a new item
addItem('Map');           // Try to add a duplicate item
addItem('Gold Coins');    // Add another new item

console.log("\n--- Scenario 2: Removing Items ---");
removeItem('Shield');           // Remove an existing item
removeItem('NonExistentItem');  // Try to remove a non-existent item
removeItem('Arrows');           // Remove another existing item

console.log("\n--- Scenario 3: Checking for Items ---");
hasItem('Sword');        // Check for an existing item
hasItem('Gold Coins');   // Check for a newly added item
hasItem('Magic Orb');    // Check for a non-existent item

console.log("\n--- Scenario 4: Sorting Inventory ---");
sortInventory();

console.log("\n--- Scenario 5: Item Transformations (map) ---");
const lengths = getItemLengths(); // Call the function, it should log its output internally
console.log(`Item lengths array returned: ${lengths}`);

console.log("\n--- Scenario 6: Item Filtering (filter) ---");
const shortItems = getShortItems(5); // Call the function, it should log its output internally
console.log(`Short items array returned: ${shortItems}`);
const veryShortItems = getShortItems(3);
console.log(`Very short items array returned: ${veryShortItems}`);


console.log("\n--- Scenario 7: Calculating Total Value (reduce) ---");
const itemPriceList = {
    'Sword': 100,
    'Shield': 80, // Note: Shield might be removed earlier depending on exact test order
    'Potion': 20,
    'Bow': 70,
    'Arrows': 5,
    'Map': 30,
    'Healing Potion': 25,
    'Gold Coins': 10
    // NonExistentItem and Magic Orb have 0 value as they are not here
};
const totalValue = calculateTotalValue(itemPriceList); // Call the function, it should log its output internally
console.log(`Total inventory value returned: ${totalValue} gold`);

console.log("\n--- Final Inventory State ---");
displayInventory(); // Display inventory one last time after all operations
```
