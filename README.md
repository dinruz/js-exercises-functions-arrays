## Overview

This repository showcases my progress and solutions for various JavaScript challenges during learning from The Odin Project, with a focus on fundamental concepts like **functions**, **array methods** and **string manipulation**. This repo will be continuously updated with new exercises from various sources.

### List of Functions exercises

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 1: add7</strong></summary>

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 3: capitalize</strong></summary>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 5: Function Add - variations </strong></summary>
  
I. Write a function `add(num1, num2)` that returns the result. Use only 'return'.

II. Write similar function `addStore(num3,num4)` and store the result in a new variable 'total'. Print the value of the total variable to the console.

III. Write this function as arrow function - `addArrow(num5,num6)`.

 [Solution: fnAdd.js](./functions-exercises/05_fnAdd.js) 

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 6: Print Even Numbers</strong></summary>
  
Write a function `printEvenNumbers(start, end)`.

Within this function, use a `for loop` to print all even numbers between start and end (inclusive of start and end if they are even). Finally, call the function with the range 1-15.

 [Solution: fnPrintEven.js](./functions-exercises/06_fnPrintEven.js) 

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 7: Roll the Dice</strong></summary>
  
Write a function `getDiceNumber(time)`. Argument represents the total number of times a standard dice should be rolled. Print the roll's sequence number and the result of that roll to the console (e.g., "1. dice number is: 3" etc.).

Call the function which should roll the dice 8 times.

 [Solution: rollDice.js](./functions-exercises/07_rollDice.js) 

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 8: Get until six üé≤</strong></summary>
  
Write a function `getUntilSix` and call it.

It should simulate rolling a die repeatedly until the number 6 is rolled.

 [Solution: getUntilSix.js](./functions-exercises/08_getUntilSix.js) 
 </details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 9: display</strong></summary>
  
Write a function `displayProduct` for displaying perfumery products. It takes a name (mandatory string) and price (optional number, defaults to 0.00 EUR).

If the product is complimentary, it's a free (gratis) item and you should input only its name. 
However, the function must always print both the name and price, regardless of whether it's free or not.

*Call the function twice:*

I.  displayProduct('Java Eau de Parfum', 150)   
II. displayProduct ('Scripted body lotion - sample') 

 [Solution: displayProduct.js](./functions-exercises/09_displayProduct.js)

## Array Exercises

  **Developed as part of:** The Odin Project assignment, challenges sourced from [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/array-methods#tasks).

  **Completion Date:** 23-07-2025


### List of Array exercises

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 1: Camelize()</strong></summary>

  Write the function `camelize(str)` that changes dash-separated words like ‚Äúmy-short-string‚Äù into camel-cased ‚ÄúmyShortString‚Äù. 
    
  That is: removes all dashes, each word after dash becomes uppercased. Examples:

```javascript
camelize("background-color") == 'backgroundColor';
camelize("list-style-image") == 'listStyleImage';
camelize("-webkit-transition") == 'WebkitTransition';
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 2: Filter range</strong></summary>


  Write a function `filterRange(arr, a, b)` that gets an array `arr`, looks for elements with values higher or equal to a and lower or equal to b and return a result as an array.
  For instance:

```javascript
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
let filtered = filterRange(arr, 1, 4);
alert( filtered ); // 3,1 (matching values)
// alert( arr ); // 5,3,8,1 (not modified)
```


[Solution: filterRange.js](./array-exercises/02_filterRange.js)

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 3: Filter range in place </strong></summary>
  
   Write a function `filterRangeInPlace(arr, a, b)` that gets an array `arr` and removes from it all values except those that are between a and b.
  The test is: `a ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ b`.
  The function should only modify the array. It should not return anything.

```javascript
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
filterRangeInPlace(arr, 1, 4); // removed the numbers except from 1 to 4
// alert( arr ); // [3, 1]
```

 [Solution: filterRangeInPlace.js](./array-exercises/03_filterRangeInPlace.js)</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 4: Sort in decreasing order </strong></summary>
  

  ```javascript
let arr = [5, 2, 1, -10, 8];
// ... your code to sort it in decreasing order
// alert( arr ); // 8, 5, 2, 1, -10
  ```

[Solution: sortInDecreasingOrder.js](./array-exercises/04_sortInDecreasingOrder.js)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 5: Copy and sort array</strong></summary>


  We have an array of strings arr. We‚Äôd like to have a sorted copy of it, but keep arr unmodified.

  Create a function `copySorted(arr)` that returns such a copy.

```javascript
let arr = ["HTML", "JavaScript", "CSS"];
let sorted = copySorted(arr);
alert( sorted ); // CSS, HTML, JavaScript
// alert( arr ); // HTML, JavaScript, CSS (no changes)
```
 
 [Solution: copyAndSortArray.js](./array-exercises/05_copyAndSortArray.js)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 6: Shuffle an array</strong></summary>

  Write the function `shuffle(array)` that shuffles (randomly reorders) elements of the array.
  Multiple runs of shuffle may lead to different orders of elements. 
  For instance:

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [3, 2, 1]
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [2, 1, 3]
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [3, 1, 2]
  // ...
```
All element orders should have an equal probability. 
For instance, [1,2,3] can be reordered as [1,2,3] or [1,3,2] or [3,1,2] etc, with equal probability of each case.
 

 [Solution: shuffleAnArray.js](./array-exercises/06_shuffleAnArray.js)
</details>


<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise 7: Filter unique array members </strong></summary>


Let arr be an array. Create a function `unique(arr)` that should return an array with unique items of arr.
For instance:

 ```javascript
 
 function unique(arr) {
    /* your code */
    }
    let strings = ["Hare", "Krishna", "Hare", "Krishna",
    "Krishna", "Krishna", "Hare", "Hare", ":-O"
    ];
    alert( unique(strings) ); // Hare, Krishna, :-O
```
