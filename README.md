This section explains the difficulty rating system used in this repository. 
It's highly **beginner-friendly**.


🟢 **Very Easy**
  These tasks are perfect for first steps. They focus on basic syntax and direct instruction execution, requiring minimal complex thought.

🟡  **Easy**
	These tasks involve connecting a few basic concepts or applying simple logic. They might include variables, conditions, or straightforward loops.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>🟡 Exercise 6: Print Even Numbers</strong></summary>
  
Write a function `printEvenNumbers(start, end)`.

Within this function, use a `for loop` to print all even numbers between start and end (inclusive of start and end if they are even). Finally, call the function with the range 1-15.

  ✔️ [Solution: PrintEven.js](./functions-exercises/06_fnPrintEven.js) 

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>🟡 Exercise 7: Roll the Dice</strong></summary>

 </details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>🟢 Exercise 9: Display products</strong></summary>
  
Write a function `displayProduct()` for displaying perfumery products. It takes a `name` (mandatory string) and `price` (optional number, defaults to '0.00 EU'R). If the product is complimentary, it's a free item and you should input only its name. However, the function must always print both the name and price, regardless of whether it's free or not.

Call the function twice:

```javascript
 displayProduct('Java Eau de Parfum', 150)   
 displayProduct('Scripted body lotion - sample') 
```

### List of Array exercises ✨

<details>
  <summary><strong>🟠 Exercise 1: Camelize()</strong></summary>

  Write the function `camelize(str)` that changes dash-separated words like “my-short-string” into camel-cased “myShortString”. That is: removes all dashes, each word after dash becomes uppercased. 
  
  Examples:

```javascript
camelize("background-color") == 'backgroundColor';
camelize("list-style-image") == 'listStyleImage';
camelize("-webkit-transition") == 'WebkitTransition';
```

✔️ [Solution: Camelize.js](./array-exercises/01_camelize.js)

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>🟡 Exercise 2: Filter range</strong></summary>

  Write a function `filterRange(arr, a, b)` that gets an array `arr`, looks for elements with values higher or equal to a and lower or equal to b and return a result as an array.
  For instance:

```javascript
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
let filtered = filterRange(arr, 1, 4);
alert( filtered ); // 3,1 (matching values)
// alert( arr ); // 5,3,8,1 (not modified)
```

 ✔️ [Solution: filterRange.js](./array-exercises/02_filterRange.js)

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>🟡 Exercise 3: Filter range in place </strong></summary>
  
   Write a function `filterRangeInPlace(arr, a, b)` that gets an array `arr` and removes from it all values except those that are between a and b. The test is: 'a ≤ arr[i] ≤ b'.

  The function should only modify the array. It should not return anything.

```javascript
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
filterRangeInPlace(arr, 1, 4); // removed the numbers except from 1 to 4
// alert( arr ); // [3, 1]
```

 ✔️ [Solution: filterRangeInPlace.js](./array-exercises/03_filterRangeInPlace.js)</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>🟢 Exercise 4: Sort in decreasing order </strong></summary>
  

  ```javascript
let arr = [5, 2, 1, -10, 8];
// ... 
  alert( arr ); // 8, 5, 2, 1, -10
  ```

[Solution: sortInDecreasingOrder.js](./array-exercises/04_sortInDecreasingOrder.js)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>🟡 Exercise 5: Copy and sort array</strong></summary>


  We have an array of strings 'arr'. We’d like to have a sorted copy of it, but keep arr unmodified.

  Create a function `copySorted(arr)` that returns such a copy.

```javascript
let arr = ["HTML", "JavaScript", "CSS"];
let sorted = copySorted(arr);
alert( sorted ); // CSS, HTML, JavaScript
// alert( arr ); // HTML, JavaScript, CSS (no changes)
```
 
  ✔️ [Solution: copyAndSortArray.js](./array-exercises/05_copyAndSortArray.js)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>🔴 Exercise 6: Shuffle an array</strong></summary>

  Write the function `shuffle(array)` that shuffles (randomly reorders) elements of the array.
  Multiple runs of shuffle may lead to different orders of elements. 
  For instance:

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [3, 2, 1]
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [2, 1, 3]
shuffle(arr);
    // arr = [3, 1, 2]
  // ...
```
All element orders should have an equal probability. 
For instance, [1,2,3] can be reordered as [1,2,3] or [1,3,2] or [3,1,2] etc, with equal probability of each case.
 

 ✔️ [Solution: shuffleAnArray.js](./array-exercises/06_shuffleAnArray.js)
</details>


<details>
  <summary><strong>🟠 Exercise 7: Filter unique array members </strong></summary>

Let `arr` be an array. Create a function `unique(arr)` that should return an array with unique items of 'arr'.
For instance:

 ```javascript
 
 function unique(arr) {
    /* your code */
    }
    let strings = ["Hare", "Krishna", "Hare", "Krishna",
    "Krishna", "Krishna", "Hare", "Hare", ":-O"
    ];
    alert( unique(strings) ); // Hare, Krishna, :-O
```

 ✔️ [Solution: filterUnique.js](./array-exercises/07_filterUnique.js)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>🟠 Exercise 8: FizzBuzz Pro </strong></summary>

Write a function `fizzBuzzPro(number)` that generates a modified FizzBuzz sequence up to a given number.

Function should: 

  - iterate from 1 up to number;
  - apply **standard FizzBuzz rules:**
    * print "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5;
    * print "Fizz" for multiples of 3;
    * print "Buzz" for multiples of 5;

  - apply **special rule**:
    * if a number contains the digit "7", it outputs "Bang!" instead of any FizzBuzz variant

   - return a single string of the results, separated by `, ` with a `.` at the very end.


 ```javascript
 
    fizzBuzzPro(20) // Expected: "1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, Bang!, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, Bang!, 18, 19, Buzz."
```

  ✔️ [Solution: fizzBuzzPro.js](./array-exercises/08_fizzBuzzPro.js)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>🔴Exercise 9: cleanAndCapitalize() </strong></summary>

Write a function `cleanAndCapitalize(text)` that takes one string and transforms the text in the following way:

* remove all punctuation characters (.,;:!?_-)
* capitalize the first letter of each word
* standardize spaces (only one space between words)

The function should return the final string like this:


 ```javascript
    cleanAndCapitalize("tHis-is somE--stranGE. text! ")
    // Expected output: "This Is Some Strange Text"

    cleanAndCapitalize(" THIS.one...   TOo_  ")
    // Expected output: "This One Too"
  ```

  ✔️ [Solution: cleanAndCapitalize.js](./array-exercises/09_cleanAndCapitalize.js)
</details>
